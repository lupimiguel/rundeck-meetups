# Rundeck by PagerDuty Meetups

We are a group of Digital Operations Professionals, DevOps, SREs and other Engineers, who want to automate, automate, automate! We organize meetups that are community-oriented, emphasize the sharing of technical stories and use cases between folks who work and build with [Rundeck by PagerDuty](https://www.rundeck.com/) open-source software actively.

Organizing and managing meetups is much easier (and fun!) when the community is part of the creative process.

Already know Rundeck OSS well? Share your knowledge and submit a talk for an upcoming session!
